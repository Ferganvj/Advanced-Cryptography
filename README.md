# Advanced Cryptography
Developing a Python app for Image Steganography. The aim of the project is to implement
(i) Encryption and Image Hiding:
- Input the Plaintext Image
- Input the Covertext Image
- Output the Stegotext Imge
(ii) Decryption
- Inout the Stegotext Image
- Input the Covertext Image
- Output the Decrypt Image

Two buttons will be required to provide options to encrypt or decrypt, subject to relevant files that are to be input and output.
In each case, a ‘Browse image file’ button should be used to search for a local image file.

The Plaintext, Covertex and Decrypt images can be .jpg files but the Stegotext image should be output (and input) as a .tiff file
